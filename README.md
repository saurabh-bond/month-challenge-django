For making the html code compatible with django (tags, filters, {{}}, {% %} ) 
install django extension in vs code 
django -- by Baptiste Darthenay

Once we install django, we are no longer able to use the html features (like type h1 and clicking on tab should generate the html element)
for making that work, lets add these settings. 
settings.json file 
"files.associations": {
  "*.html": "django-html"
},
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "django-html": "html"
}

How to open settings.json file 
1. Press Cmd + Shift + P to open the Command Palette.
2. Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and press Enter.
This opens the settings.json file where you can add custom configurations.
